# Hyperion Datasource -  Native Plugin

Hyperion is a brand new timeseries aggregation engine, which provides graphite-compatible API wit some additional extensions.

Datasource is forked from Graphite one, so documentation from [http://docs.grafana.org/datasources/graphite/](http://docs.grafana.org/datasources/graphite/) should be mostly applicable.
For any suggestions or bug reports post to [hyperion github](https://github.com/codewise/hyperion-backend/issues)

List of supported functions is also available on [github wiki page](https://github.com/codewise/hyperion-backend/wiki/Graphite-functions-implementation-status)
