# Tornimo Datasource -  Native Plugin

Tornimo is a brand new timeseries aggregation engine, which provides graphite-compatible API wit some additional extensions.

Datasource is forked from Graphite one, so documentation from [http://docs.grafana.org/datasources/graphite/](http://docs.grafana.org/datasources/graphite/) should be mostly applicable.
For any suggestions or bug reports post to [tornimo github](https://github.com/tornimo/tornimo-grafana-datasource/issues)
